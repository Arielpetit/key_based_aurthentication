# Key-Based Authentication

This repository provides code and examples for implementing key-based authentication with a focus on generating, storing, and using key pairs, along with working with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It demonstrates the entire process, from key pair generation to signing JWTs and verifying their authenticity.

## Key Features:

- **Key Pair Generation**: Demonstrates how to generate a public-private key pair for signing and verifying JWTs.
- **Storing and Retrieving Keys**: Shows best practices for securely storing and retrieving keys to maintain a secure authentication system.
- **JWT Generation and Signing**: Explains how to create and sign JWTs using a private key, ensuring that the payload and claims are securely transmitted.
- **JWT Signature Verification**: Covers how to verify the authenticity of a JWT by checking its signature using the corresponding public key.
- **Hashing Payload**: Implements the hashing of sensitive data (e.g., phone numbers) to ensure integrity before generating JWTs.
- **Security Best Practices**: Emphasizes the importance of secure key management, and best practices for handling JWTs, such as avoiding logging sensitive information.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to understand and implement key-based authentication systems using JWTs. It includes detailed code examples and explanations to walk developers through the entire process, from generating keys to verifying JWT signatures, and ensuring the integrity and security of data.

## How to Use

Explore the code to understand how to generate key pairs, create and sign JWTs, and verify JWT signatures. The code provides examples and implementations for each part of the process.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never log sensitive data** such as private keys or JWTs in the console, especially in production.
- **Store private keys securely** (e.g., in environment variables or a key vault).
- **Use HTTPS** to protect data in transit when transmitting JWTs.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a foundational understanding of key-based authentication systems, key pair generation, JWT signing and verification, and data integrity checks. With the provided examples, you can build secure authentication systems and implement JWTs in your own applications.
